# BootyGuard SWL mod

Warns you if you are about to open a New York Raid reward chest that has a lower elite level than the highest available to you.

It temporarily disables [autolooting](https://github.com/SecretFox/AutoRepair) in those instances.


## Installation instructions

Extract the zip file into `<SWL directory>\Data\Gui\Custom\Flash\` and restart the game.
